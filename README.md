## Dynamic Branch Predictor Using Perceptron Learning Algorithm

### Overview

Modern processors rely heavily on branch prediction to improve performance by minimizing pipeline stalls caused by conditional branches. This project implements a dynamic branch predictor based on the Perceptron Learning Algorithm, a lightweight machine learning technique capable of learning long-term branch behavior patterns.
